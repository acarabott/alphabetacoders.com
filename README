These are the notes for a weekly programming club taught at City of London School for Boys.

The students are working from *Getting Started with Processing* by Casey Reas & Ben Fry. 

These notes are written up the week *after* each workshop based on what we did in the previous week, so that students who missed sessions can catch up; hence a lot of the examples are directly from the book. 

We often take tangents and the students spend half their time making the examples "their own" by modifying and playing with them.

## Tools - sketchpad.cc
We use a private instance of [http://sketchpad.cc/](http://sketchpad.cc/) kindly provided by Ari Bader-Natal. 

This lets students see my code on their screen, and lets me put their work up on the projector and do group debugging (both very productive activities).
